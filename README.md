# Basic-Linear-Regression-Model

Implementation of a basic linear regression model learned through Coursera's Machine Learning Course (week 1). Everything implemented from scratch with as little reference back to course material as possible.

Dataset:

The dataset being examined is a random dataset pulled from https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/regression/regression.html 

The purpose of this exercise is to solidify the concepts of the course.
